We're still waiting for a brave explorer to write this section for us, as we don't use WSL. If you're willing to do this, please contact Information Security :)

**Please note** that WSL support is experimental. It may or may not work. This is not being actively developed because we don't use WSL but any issues or feedback will be addressed.

You can run `.exe` files within WSL, and you may also find that the Linux version works.

* Windows (x64) [keyconjurer-windows.exe](./keyconjurer-windows.exe)
* Linux (x64) [keyconjurer-linux-amd64](./keyconjurer-linux-amd64)
